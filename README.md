### HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Franco Freso Dixo
In light of my educational background and technological experiences, I have ventured into the realm of development with my inaugural project Inbuscap.Id. As I embark on this journey, I am eager to document my experiences and skills gained, believing they will serve as a valuable asset in my pursuit of a career as a Front End Developer. Presently, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply and further develop the knowledge I have acquired.
